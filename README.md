# Vowel Counter

This Python script takes input characters in lowercase and counts the occurrences of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in the provided input. The user is prompted to enter a string of lowercase characters, which is then stored in the 'values' list. The script iterates through each vowel and counts its occurrences in the input using nested loops. The individual counts for each vowel are printed, and the total number of vowels is calculated and displayed at the end.
